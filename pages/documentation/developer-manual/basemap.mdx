# Basemap

Baremaps comes with a 
[default tileset and stylesheet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-baremaps/tree/main/basemap) 
that can be used to generate vector tiles. The stylesheet is based on the
[OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto)
style.

It is an ongoing effort to create an attribution-free map style.
Your contributions are welcome.
