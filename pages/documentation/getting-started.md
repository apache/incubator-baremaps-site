# Getting Started

This section will get you started with the setup of Apache Baremaps to execute the examples. If you plan on running the 
code directly, or using Apache Baremaps as a library, you should refer to the [Developer Manual](/developer-manual/).

After installing the necessary components, the [Examples](/documentation/examples/) explain how to use Apache Baremaps to create a vector tileset from an OpenStreetMap extract, create an IP to location web service, and much more.

Now head into [Installing the CLI](/documentation/getting-started/installing-the-cli/) to see how to set up the Apache Baremaps command line interface on your
own machine to execute the examples.
