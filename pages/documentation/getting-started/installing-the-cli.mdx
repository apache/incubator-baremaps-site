#  Installing the CLI

In order to run Apache Baremaps, you first need to install Java 17 or a later version.
[SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) to install and upgrade Java.

To install Apache Baremaps, download and unzip the latest [release](https://github.com/apache/incubator-baremaps/releases/latest).
Then, add the `/bin` folder to your `PATH` variable:

```
wget https://github.com/apache/incubator-baremaps/releases/latest/download/baremaps.zip
unzip baremaps.zip
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/baremaps/bin
```

Calling the `baremaps` command should now result in an output similar to the following:

```
Usage: baremaps [COMMAND]
A toolkit for producing vector tiles.
Commands:
  import  Import OpenStreetMap data in the Postgresql database.
  update  Update OpenStreetMap data in the Postgresql database.
  export  Export vector tiles from the Postgresql database.
  serve   Serve vector tiles from the the Postgresql database.
```

From there, head into [Installing PostGIS](/documentation/getting-started/installing-postgis/) if you plan to work with vector tiles.

If you want to work on [Geocoding](/documentation/examples/geocoding/) or [IP to location](/documentation/examples/ip-to-location/), head directly into the related examples.
