# Basemap

Apache Baremaps comes with a [default schema and style](https://baremaps.apache.org/documentation/basemap/) similar to [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

We chose the [Apache License](https://github.com/apache/incubator-baremaps/blob/main/LICENSE) so that map vendors can create derived work without attributing the Apache Baremaps project on the map.
The only requirement is to give proper credit to the wonderful contributors behind the data sources, such as [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) or [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).
Notice that this schema and style are now used by default to display vector maps on the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Vector_map).

While the quality of the schema and style keeps improving, contributions, improvements, and feedback are welcome and encouraged.

import Map from '@/components/map';

<div style={{ marginTop: 20, height: 450 }}>
  <Map />
</div>

## Build the basemap

In order to build the basemap locally, move to the `/basemap` directory and run the following workflow:

```bash
baremaps workflow execute --file=import.js
```

> Note: If you are using Docker, you need to increase the storage allocated to Docker to at least 20GB.

Depending on your machine and internet connection, the process can take up to 30 minutes.
