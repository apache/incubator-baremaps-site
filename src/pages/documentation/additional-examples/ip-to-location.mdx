# Create an IP to location web service

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to create an IP to location index and then serve it in a simple web application.

## Dataset

The data used to create an IP to location index is publicly available from the [Internet routing registries (IRRs)](https://www.irr.net/docs/list.html) which includes the [Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry)

The data are formatted following [RPSL](https://irr.net/rpsl-guide/) specifications and contain records that link IP address ranges to organisations along with some metadata.

## Generate the index

```bash
cd examples/ip-to-location
baremaps workflow execute --file workflow.js
```

The workflow executed in the above command does the following:

- Download and decompress the data from the IRRs
- Download and create a Geocoding index (see the [Geocoding](/documentation/additional-examples/geocoding/) example)
- Iterate over every entry in the registries to extract the IP address ranges and the associated metadata to query the Geocoding index and extract a latitude and a longitude.

## Serve the data

```bash
baremaps iploc serve --database iploc.db --port 9000
```

A simple web application serves the Geonames index. Go to your browser (`http://localhost:9000/`) to see it in action.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learnt how to create an IP to location index and serve it in a simple web application.
IP to location has many uses, one of which is to locate users that connect to a website to generate statistics.
