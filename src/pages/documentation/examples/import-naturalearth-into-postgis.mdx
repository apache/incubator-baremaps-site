# Import Natural Earth data into PostGIS

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use Baremaps to import Natural Earth data in a PostGIS database.

Notice that the following steps assume that the Apache Baremaps CLI and PostGIS are [installed](/documentation/getting-started/).

## Dataset

[Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales.

The following workflow will download the Natural Earth data, decompress it, and finally import it in the database.

```bash
cd examples/naturalearth
baremaps workflow execute --file workflow.json
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learnt how to import Natural Earth data in PostGIS.

Now that you have inserted the data into the PostGIS database, you can use follow the [Serve Vector Tiles from PostGIS](/documentation/examples/serve-and-export-vector-tiles/) example to serve
your PostGIS data directly as Vector Tiles in a web application with live reload capabilities.
