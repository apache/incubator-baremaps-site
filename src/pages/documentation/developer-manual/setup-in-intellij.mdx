# Set up in IntelliJ IDEA

To open the project with IntelliJ, go under `file -> open -> ...` and select the `pom.xml` file in the root of the project.

We added a few configurations to run the code quickly. You can find them in the `Run/Debug Configurations` dropdown in the top right corner of the IDE.

These run configurations are either prefixed with an example name (e.g. `openstreetmap-`) corresponding to a directory in the `examples` folder or with `basemap-` and `daylight-` for the `basemap` and `daylight` folders.
The suffix usually indicate the command used to run the configuration.

For instance, to jump into the development of the `basemap`, you start a postgis container, run the `basemap-workflow` configuration to prepare the database, and run the `basemap-dev` configuration to serve the basemap.
The `baremaps-dev` configuration will watch for changes in the style and the tileset and automatically reload the browser when changes are detected.
