# Basemap

Baremaps comes with a
[default tileset and stylesheet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-baremaps/tree/main/basemap)
that can be used to generate vector tiles. The stylesheet is based on the
[OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto)
style.
It is an ongoing effort to create an attribution-free map style.
Your contributions are welcome.

import Map from '@/components/map';

<div style={{ marginTop: 20, height: 450 }}>
  <Map />
</div>

## Build the basemap

In order to build the basemap locally, move to the `/basemap` directory and run the following workflow:

```bash
baremaps workflow execute --file=workflow.js
```

> Note: If you are using Docker, you need to increase the storage allocated to Docker to at least 20GB.

Depending on your machine and internet connection, the process can take up to 30 minutes.
