# Basemap

Baremaps comes with a 
[default tileset and stylesheet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-baremaps/tree/main/basemap) 
that can be used to generate vector tiles. The stylesheet is based on the
[OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto)
style. 
It is an ongoing effort to create an attribution-free map style.
Your contributions are welcome.

import Map from '@/components/map'

<div style={{marginTop: 20, height: 450}}>
<Map />
</div>
