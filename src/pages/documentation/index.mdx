# Introduction

Apache Baremaps is an [open source](https://github.com/apache/incubator-baremaps/blob/main/LICENSE) toolkit and a set of infrastructure components for creating, publishing, and operating online maps.
It provides a data pipeline enabling developers to build maps with different data sources.
It offers live reload capabilities that allow cartographers to rapidely customize the content and the style of a map.
It comes with a [default schema and style](https://baremaps.apache.org/documentation/getting-started/) similar to [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).
Finally, it aims at providing a set of services commonly used in online maps, such as location search and IP to location.
